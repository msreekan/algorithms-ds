Problem Statement: [Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Search Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-search-tree/#/description)
******************************************************************************

Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of

two given nodes in the BST. According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: 

“The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes v and w as the

lowest node in T that has both v and w as descendants (where we allow a node

to be a descendant of itself).”
