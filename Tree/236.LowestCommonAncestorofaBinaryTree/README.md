Problem Statement: [Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree ](https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-tree/#/description)
******************************************************************************

Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes

in the tree. 

According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor

is defined between two nodes v and w as the lowest node in T that has both

v and w as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”
