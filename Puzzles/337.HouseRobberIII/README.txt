Problem Statement: House Robber III
******************************************************************************
The thief has found himself a new place for his thievery again. There is only
 one entrance to this area, called the "root." Besides the root, each house 
has one and only one parent house. After a tour, the smart thief realized 
that "all houses in this place forms a binary tree". It will automatically 
contact the police if two directly-linked houses were broken into on the 
same night. 

Determine the maximum amount of money the thief can rob tonight without 
alerting the police.
